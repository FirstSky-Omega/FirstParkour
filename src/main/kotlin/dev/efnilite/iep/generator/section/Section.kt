/**
 * Represents a section of the total parkour of size [KNOTS].
 *
 * Memory model — addresses the 8 GB / 2 h leak users reported on long elytra runs:
 *
 *  - We store [Vector] coordinates, NOT Bukkit [org.bukkit.block.Block] instances. A
 *    Block lookup goes through World#getBlockAt which loads the chunk if it isn't
 *    resident; we'd be loading thousands of chunks per minute as the player flies and
 *    Paper holds onto them for a while (chunks have ~100 KB of palette/lighting state
 *    each). Vectors are 24 bytes and pin nothing.
 *  - Display blocks are sent via [org.bukkit.entity.Player.sendBlockChange] taking a
 *    [org.bukkit.Location] + [org.bukkit.block.data.BlockData], which goes through the
 *    packet path WITHOUT requiring the chunk to be loaded server-side.
 *  - [blockMap] is dropped to null in [clear] so the GC can reclaim the per-section
 *    Vector lists; a single mature section without this fix retained ~10–50 KB of
 *    points + ~2500 short-lived chunk handles per generation cycle.
