/**
 * Pipes pending client-side block updates to the player without leaking server memory.
 *
 * Storage: [Vector] positions rather than [org.bukkit.block.Block]. Block lookup forces
 * a chunk load and pins the chunk in Paper's holder; we'd be loading thousands of chunks
 * per minute as the player flies. Vectors are 24 bytes and pin nothing.
 *
 * Render: at SEND TIME we resolve `v.toLocation(world).block.state`, set its type to the
 * style colour, and ship a batched MultiBlockChange via [Player.sendBlockChanges]. This
 * is exactly the upstream-IEP render path — only the storage tier changed.
 *
 * Concurrency: `queue()` runs from an async continuation; `check`/`flush`/`clear` from
 * the main thread. All four synchronize on `this`; network/state work happens outside.
